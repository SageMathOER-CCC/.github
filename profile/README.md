# Welcome to the Chicago City Colleges OER for SageMath

## Empowering the next generation of mathematicians and computer scientists with open-source tools.

We are developing essential resources for students to use mathematical software effectively. Our goal is to streamline the learning process with SageMath. This approach helps students focus more on mathematics and reduces the friction of learning how to code. Our resources are designed for all math students, regardless of programming experience. SageMath covers a range of mathematical areas such as algebra, geometry, number theory, cryptography, numerical computation, calculus, and more. Currently, we are developing an online textbook for college-level discrete math courses, utilizing SageMath.

### What is SageMath?

[SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) is a free, open-source mathematics software system, based on Python. It integrates well-known open-source packages that include NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, Sympy, Maxima, GAP, FLINT, R, and many [others](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/). SageMath is fulfilling the need for a robust and free alternative to proprietary software like Magma, Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab.

### Why Discrete Mathematics with SageMath?

Our first textbook focuses on discrete mathematics. SageMath allows students to explore and visualize complex concepts, boosting their understanding and skills in this essential subject.
